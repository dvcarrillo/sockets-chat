# Simple Java chat with GUI

A simple chat programmed in Java and Swing, using sockets. There is a client and a server, which can
send messages between them using a username. The server defines the IP and the port, and the
client needs to specify it in order to talk to the desired server. Once connected, they will be
able to send messages between them.
